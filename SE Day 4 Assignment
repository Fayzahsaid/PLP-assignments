1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure deadlines are met?
Timely delivery is important because it ensures users get the software when they need it, prevents cost overruns, and maintains
stakeholder trust. Project managers can use scheduling tools, break tasks into milestones, set realistic deadlines, and monitor progress regularly.

2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Cost control ensures resources are used efficiently and the project remains financially viable. Strategies include detailed budgeting, tracking expenses, 
prioritizing essential features, and avoiding unnecessary changes.

3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile: Flexible, user feedback-driven, but requires continuous involvement.
Waterfall: Structured, better for fixed requirements, but less adaptable to changes.

4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa?
Agile: Best for projects that need frequent updates, like assistive AI tools for the blind.
Waterfall: Best for projects with fixed requirements, like an ATM interface for visually impaired users.

5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods include usability testing, accessibility compliance checks, automated testing, and feedback from blind users. High standards ensure the software is reliable, 
accessible, and easy to use.

6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
A clear scope prevents feature creep and keeps the project focused. WBS breaks the project into small tasks (e.g., voice navigation, Braille support) to improve tracking
and resource allocation.

7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
A schedule keeps tasks on track, ensuring timely delivery. Gantt charts provide a visual timeline of tasks, showing dependencies and deadlines clearly.

8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
The software aims to help blind users navigate digital devices easily through voice commands, screen reading, and haptic feedback. This is important as it
enhances independence and accessibility.

9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
A well-defined problem ensures the solution is user-centered, focusing on essential accessibility needs rather than unnecessary features.

10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
It’s an intelligent assistive tool that helps blind users interact with digital devices through voice control, audio feedback, and touch navigation.

11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
AI-powered voice assistant
Screen reader with natural voice output
Gesture and Braille-based input support
Real-time object recognition for navigation

12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
The assistive technology market is growing due to increasing awareness of digital accessibility. Many organizations are investing in solutions 
for visually impaired users.

13. How can understanding market trends inform your software’s positioning and development?
By analyzing trends like AI-driven accessibility and smartphone-based assistive tools, the software can be designed to be innovative, affordable, and widely adoptable.
